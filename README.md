# Java Calculator

This is simple desktop GUI calculator written in Java.
My goal with this project was to learn more about swing components such as JButtons, JPanels, JTextFields and so on.

### Code Structure
The implementation is done in a single java main class:

1. First we define instance variables;
2. Secondly, we initializes them in the constructor.
3. The main method instantiates a new Calculator from the constructor.
4. The override method adds functionality to the buttons.
